That's why we've added support for __add__ to your class, making it possible to use expressions like obj + 10 without error. Specifically, obj + 10 is translated to obj. add (10), and the custom method __add__ can do whatever action that is appropriate for adding 10 to the custom class. A question arises, however, when considering expressions such as 10 + obj, which is (10). __add (myobj)? Since obj is a new type and 10 is an instance of a built-in type in Python, the __add__ function on 10 will fail with the NotImplemented exception. __radd__ is utilised in these kinds of situations. In the beginning, Python will (10). If __add (myobj) returns NotImplemented, Python will see if the right-hand operand supports __radd__, and if it does, it will execute obj. radd (10) instead of throwing a TypeError."
